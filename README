This Java library opens a Wikipedia dump in form of an XML file and extracts the
content of the individual articles. Content refers to the article text, a list
of the links to other Wikipedia articles and more. It can also create a Lucene
index, adding the article contents into different fields.

Experimenting with new random indexing methods and information retrieval
methods, the Wikipedia corpus turned out to be an intuitive base for
experiments. But I couldn't really find a tool that would extract the textual
information (stripped of all wiki markup) from the Wikipedia articles. So I
wrote a Java program, intended to be used as a library, to do this job.


Right now, there are two Java classes:
* Extractor.java, which does the actual job of loading and parsing the dump
  file and extracting the articles
* MakeLuceneIndex.java, which uses the Extractor to walk through the complete
  dump file and puts the contents into a Lucene index


The regular expressions that strip the wiki markup code are not exactly perfect
but were good enough for my purposes. I'm inviting anybody to use this project
and I'll happily include any improvements. Special thanks go to rvedam for
contributing the build.xml and getting me started on Java development.



Dependencies:

Currently, this project depends on the following libraries:
* Apache Lucene (currently version 3.0). You can download the Lucene library at
  http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/


Compilation Instructions:

1) download Apache Lucene 3.0.3 and copy the file lucene-core-3.0.3.jar into the
   lib directory

2) run "ant" on the top level without arguments. The output from ant will be a
   jar located in the build/jar directory

3) run the jar with "ant run". Currently, you'll have to hard code the location
   of the wikidump file and the Lucene index in MakeLuceneIndex.java. An
   unzipped wikidump file from 2011-04-05 (enwiki-20110405-pages-articles.xml)
   is expected in the current working directory and this is also where the
   Lucene index will be created

Optional:

4) run "ant doc" to create a doc directory containing the Javadoc API
   documentation in the doc/ directory
